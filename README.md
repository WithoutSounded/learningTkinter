Repl will automatically(force) running program in "main.py"

quick test: import tkinter; tkinter._test()
```


with [python refresher](https://github.com/tecladocode/python-refresher)










small tips or common convention  
:in terminal  (Y/n)  
uppercase Y is the default, if you type everything except n  
lowercase n is the specific word user has to type to stop  
`while user_input != "n": blabla`  

import blablabla as bla: also called as "alias import"

`using ttk to costumize app more like native apps`
